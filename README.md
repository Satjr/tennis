# KATA Tennis

This project is about implementing a simple tennis game score system
## Getting Started

Once you cloned the project all you need to do is :

```
npm install
```
```
npm run transpile 
```
## Note

You should loot at ``` src/main.js ``` not ``` public/main.js```. 
This is because ``` src/main.js``` is ES6 transpiled in ES5 to ```public/main.js``` through babel.
